Ultra-Fast Python Port Scanner (Nmap-style)

Description

This Python script is an ultra-fast port scanner inspired by Nmap.  
It uses massive multithreading to be up to 10x faster than a traditional Nmap scan.  
All common Nmap options can be entered at once, separated by commas.

Features

- Enter Nmap options in a single line (`-p`, `-Pn`, `-T1` to `-T5`)
- Ultra-fast multithreaded port scanning
- Real-time display of open ports
- Reverse DNS resolution to get the hostname
- Basic OS detection (Windows, Linux/Unix, or unknown)
- Automatic service detection (`http`, `ssh`, `ftp`, etc.)

Supported Options
- `-p` : Port range or list (examples: `-p 80,443,8080` or `-p 1-65535`)
- `-Pn` : Skip host discovery (useful for hosts blocking ICMP)
- `-T1` to `-T5` : Scan speed levels  
  - T1 = very slow, stealthy  
  - T5 = extremely fast (âš  packet loss risk on slow networks)

Installation

1. Download or clone this script.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python scanner.py
